# PracticalWorkII
This project is aimed to develop a website for ski enthusiasts, offering ski travel packages coupled with vibrant party "apr√©s skis" and music festivals in the breathtaking landscape of Andorra. 
The main goal of the website is to provide users with an immersive experience, showcasing the thrill os skiing alongside the excitement os lively festivals, thereby attracting potential customers to book these unique travel experiences. 

Key elements: 
1. Home page - A captivating landing page highlighting the essence of ski travels and festival vibes in Andorra. It includes stunning visuals, concise descriptions, and call-to-action buttons for exploring packages.
2. Topic page - Detailed information about ski resorts, package inclusions (ski equipment, lessons, accommodation), and itineraries tailored for various skiing proficiency levels. Descriptions of upcoming music festivals, party schedules, artist line-ups, and ticket booking options for attendees interested in combining skiing with entertainment.
A user-friendly booking platform allowing visitors to select travel dates, choose packages, and make reservations seamlessly.
3. Contact & about me pages - The contact includes a interface to insert the user's details to contact the "ski organisation". In addition, outlines my personal details and background as well as how I was related to this career. It also includes social media links, email & my personal CV. 
4. Degree & fundamentals pages - Degree outlines the description of my career and it shows the different subjects for each academic year and the number of credits each one weighs. Within the degree page there is a link that redirects to the fundamentals page. In the fundamentals page I show the main goal of the subject as well as the content. 

Problems during development:
1. Information Creation: Creating high-quality imagery and interesting information for both the ski and festival experiences necessitated substantial coordination with a variety of stakeholders.

2. User Experience: Several design revisions were required to balance the aesthetics and functionality of the website to achieve an appealing design without compromising usability.

Conclusions:
- I have enjoyed developing this website since the moment when all my classmates had already started and I still had no idea on which topic centralise the website. Although, when I had my topic then the process was very entertaining. Although, I have to admit there were moments where I had difficulties in formatting the website, especially the CSS document. Despite encountering hurdles during development, the project culminated in a visually stunning and functionally robust website. The integration complexities were successfully mitigated through dedicated development efforts and strategic partnerships with vendors. Additionally, streamlining content creation processes helped in delivering an engaging user experience.Moving forward, continuous updates and improvements will be essential to keep the website dynamic and aligned with changing travel trends and user preferences. Regular feedback collection and analysis will aid in enhancing the overall user journey and maintaining the website's appeal as a go-to platform for ski enthusiasts seeking unique travel experiences in Andorra.
I hope that in the upcoming years I can improve my html & CSS skills gradually to develop my own website and I can launch it to the every user in the internet.
